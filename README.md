Levenshtein Edit Distance for Fuzzy String Matching
================================

Ruby implementation of Levenshtein's edit distance algorithm ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance ) with a small tweak to return a percentage as a match value.

100% (1.0) is an exact match, 0% is completely different.

The Ruby syntax allows for expression of this algorithm in about half the lines of a Java implementation ( http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/162790/Fuzzy-String-Matching-with-Edit-Distance )
